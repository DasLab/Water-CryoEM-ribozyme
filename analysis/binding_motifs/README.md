# Analysis of binding motifs

## Analysis of water and mg positions

To get the list of closest bound RNA atoms to each ion and water run `python get_mg_water_closest_atoms.py` which produces [22A_mg_water_closest_atoms.csv](22A_mg_water_closest_atoms.csv) and [23A_mg_water_closest_atoms.csv](23A_mg_water_closest_atoms.csv) for the 2.2 and 2.3 Ã… structures respectively.
